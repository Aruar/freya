			<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: You're missing the cygwin dlls. Please get the latest dll at cygwin web site: <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">http://www.cygwin.com</a>.

			<br />

			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: <I>My map-server can not load maps.</I><br />
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Edit your conf/grf-files.txt file and verify if all your grf files have correct path.<br />
			                                           Note: only one grf file is needed, if all mentioned maps are inside.<br />
			                                           If paths are good, check if you have all maps in grf files. Then, remove missing maps from the list inside conf/map_athena.conf file.<br />
			<br />

			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: <I>My server starts and stops immediatly (windows/win32 compilation).</I><br />
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: You probably don't have installed the 'zlib.dll' library on your computer.<br />

			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: <I>How can I create rapidly an account for my tests?</I><br />
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: In the 'login_athena.conf' file, activate the 'new_account' option.<br />

			                                           You connect, and type an accout name followed by _ F or _ M according to the sex which you wish.<br />
			                                           Type a password with a minimum of 4 characters, followed by '@' and the administration password setted in the 'login_athena.conf' file ('admin_pass' option).<br />
			                                           While validating, you will obtain 'unknown account'. However, your account will have been created.<br />
			                                           Type the account name (without _ F or _ M) and the password (without the '@' followed by the administration password).<br />
			                                           Validate and play.<br />
			<br />

			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: <I>How can I create an account for a player?</I><br />
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Start Freya.<br />
			                                           Run the PERL software 'ladmin' from the directory /bin/tool.<br />
			                                           If it can not connect to your login-server, check the settings of connection at start of the file 'ladmin' with a text editor.<br />
			                                           Type 'help', to display commands (including the one to create accounts).<br />
			<br />

			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: <I>How can my players create an account to play?</I><br />

			                                           Tell to your players to connect with a web explorer on http://<login-server_adress>:<login-server_port>.<br />
			                                           Now, they can create their account on the displayed page.<br />
			                                           Note: you must have activate the httpd server (enabled by default).<br />
			<br />

			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: <I>I connect login-server, then choose a character, press enter and... !immediately! see message "disconnected from server".</I><br />
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: It's the packet database related problem. Edit your packet_db.txt file from db/ directory. It looks like:<br />

			                                           0x0089,8,ticksend,4<br />
			                                           ...<br />
			                                           //2005-06-28aSakexe<br />
			                                           0x009b,32,wanttoconnection,9:15:23:27:31<br />
			                                           0x0089,13,ticksend,9<br />
			                                           ...
			                                           And so on...<br />
			                                           Now if your exec is from (for example) 2005-05-26, comment (//) all that's above 2005-05-09 (but don't comment first segment - shared packets) and comment all that's below the next packet versions (from 2005-06-28 in this case).<br />
			                                           Uncomment 2005-05-26 section.<br />
			                                           Then, restart map-server and play.<br />
			<br />

			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: <I>What is the 'import' file for?</I><br />
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Most people don't know the real use of the 'import' files. After you do, you will wonder what you ever did without it.<br />
			                                           The main thing it does, is provide a way for you to change your config settings without having to modify the actual files. You can test some settings by this way.<br />
			<br />

			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: <I>How does the 'import' file work?</I><br />
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: You place only the settings you have changed in the 'import' files.<br />
			                                           Say you want to change your job experience rate from the default (100) to 2x (200). Well then you would place this in your import/battle_conf.txt file (folder and name of the 'import' file are mentioned in your 'import' line):<br />
			                                           job_exp_rate: 200<br />
			                                           You don't need the comment (it's only a comment!), but you can add it for clarity sake.<br />
			                                           Now this new setting takes place over the setting in battle_athena.conf file.<br />
			                                           How? Simple. When the server reads the 'import' line, it reads the mentioned file and all values inside this file replace previously readed values. The last readed setting of each option is the used setting.<br />
			                                           But, if you add another 'import' file with this option or change this option after the 'import' line, your 'import' setting will not be used. The last readed value is always the value used by the server.<br />
